= Highlight

Highlight is a simple syntax highlighting plugin for Ruby on Rails. It's basically a wrapper around the popular http://pygments.org
highlighter that's written in Python and supports a huge number of languages.

See the API docs at http://docs.github.com/marcoow/highlight.

The CI server is at http://ci.simplabs.com/highlight.

Highlight provides a new method that's available in views:

  highlight(language, code = nil, &block)

+language+ may be either a Symbolor a String (see supported languages below). The code can be passed either as a string or inside
a block, e.g.:

  highlight(:ruby, 'class Test; end')

or

  highlight(:ruby) do
    <<-EOF
      class Test
        end
    EOF
  end

To perform the highlighting, the code is first written to a file in /tmp, e.g.:

  /tmp/highlight_1225993290.70882

This file is the passed to pygments that returns the HTML and so on...

Since writing that file, passing its contents on to pygments, retrieve the result etc. takes a while, all highlighted source
code should be cached of course, e.g.:

  <% cache do %>
    <%= highlight(:ruby, 'class Test; end') -%>
  <% end %>

== Installation

Installation is as easy as (for Rails > 2.1):

  ./script/plugin install git@github.com:marcoow/highlight.git

The hightlight.css stylesheet that contains the neccessary style definitions should be copied to your public/stylesheets directory automagically.

If you are on Rails < 2.1, do this from your RAILS_ROOT

  git clone git@github.com:marcoow/highlight.git vendor/plugins/highlight

In this case you would have to copy the hightlight.css stylesheets manually from vendor/plugins/highlight/assets/stylesheets/.

If you don't have python and pygments installed, you will need that too. For instructions on installing pygments,
refer to http://pygments.org/docs/installation/


== TODOs/ future plans

At the moment there are neither TODOs nor future plans. If you want ot suggest any, do so at http://github.com/marcoow/highlight/issues.
